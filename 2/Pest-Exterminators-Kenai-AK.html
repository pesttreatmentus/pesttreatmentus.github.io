<p>Technology is changing the method we interact with the people and things around us. When mobile data-capture devices were presented, pest control experts were able to catch real-time information about the place and nature of pest problems and then save it in a main database online that both center managers and pest control experts could access.</p>

Modern crop varieties often inadvertently produce conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest species which have actually tired deeper into larger fruit making them inaccessible to natural opponents). Expect SARS-CoV-2 to behave like an intrusive species presented to a new location when resources are plentiful (that is, people without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered items to utilize in management (such as federally authorized medications).</p>
