<p>Since of their prospective damage to pest control workers, customers, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are heavily controlled by Federal law. Fungi: Beauveria bassiana is utilized for control of lepidopterous pests. The interactions between crop and pest (as well as the environment) are extremely essential.

<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
