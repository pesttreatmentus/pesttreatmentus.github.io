<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly solely about lowering pesticide usage.

<h3>Natural Pest Control Is Far Better Than Synthetic Chemicals Cornelia GA</h3>
<p>Innovation is changing the method we interact with individuals and items around us.

<p>Do not keep too many plants or haphazard bundles of papers as moisture and cellulose draw in termites.
