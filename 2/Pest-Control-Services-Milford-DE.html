<p>In reference to the principle of integrating using other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
