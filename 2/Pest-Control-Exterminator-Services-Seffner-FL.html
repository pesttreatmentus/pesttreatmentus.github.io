Crop losses due to diseases, arthropods, and weeds, though contested by some as a valid measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on expanded to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
