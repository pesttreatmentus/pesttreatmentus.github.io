<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>Likewise, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the exact same location might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control involves non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the location tidy and totally free of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space in between the bottom of a door and the floor.</p>
