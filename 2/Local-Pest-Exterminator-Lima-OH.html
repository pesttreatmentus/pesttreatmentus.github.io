Utilizing entomopathogenic germs, fungis, microsporidia, nematodes, or infections, and fermentation byproducts of some microbes against arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens normally come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and yard care products are most efficient when they are used effectively.
