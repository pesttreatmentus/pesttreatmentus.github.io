<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be amazed to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
