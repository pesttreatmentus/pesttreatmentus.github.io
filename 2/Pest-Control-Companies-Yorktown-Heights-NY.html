Testing may entail analyzing plants and taping the number of pests or amount of damage observed, or traps may be used to capture the pest species to approximate pest abundance.</p>
<p>Numerous newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g.-- bug, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active part might be altered to offer increased biological activity or stability. The majority of researchers concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
