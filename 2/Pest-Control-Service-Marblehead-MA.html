<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>Perennial crops represent unique difficulties and opportunities for IPM and they represent a good model for analyzing its concepts and application. A chemical-free choice which has actually been gaining appeal in the field of pest approach is used to handle problems brought on by fleas, bed bugs, and other insects.
