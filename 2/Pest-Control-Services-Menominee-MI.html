<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about minimizing pesticide usage.

<p>Otherwise, their effectiveness is susceptible to neutralization by resistance in the exact same manner similar to pesticides. The use of low-volume spray equipment minimizes general pesticide usage and labor expense. This also made it simple to track several facilities and allowed for more prompt corrective actions and more targeted pest-control treatments.

The generic term pesticides" can apply to a wide spectrum of chemicals, including insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ).

The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
