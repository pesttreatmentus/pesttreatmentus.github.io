<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about minimizing pesticide usage.

<p>Otherwise, their effectiveness is susceptible to neutralization by resistance in the exact same manner similar to pesticides. The use of low-volume spray equipment minimizes general pesticide usage and labor expense. This also made it simple to track several facilities and allowed for more prompt corrective actions and more targeted pest-control treatments.

The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
