IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxic substances in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
