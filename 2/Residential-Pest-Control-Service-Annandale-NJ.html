Under this scheme, bug control was "monitored" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>

Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>Every Orkin pest control expert is trained using our award-winning accreditation program that includes credited class work from Purdue University, treatment strategies, and if essential, different specialized pest and industry-specific training.
