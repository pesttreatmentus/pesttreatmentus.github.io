<p>The method to be picked for IPM depends on many elements, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests cause considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic house health is disregarded, the results of other kinds of pest control will be exceptionally short-term as the pests will quickly be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>Generally, the main aim of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management goals of sites such as residential and commercial structures, yard and grass locations, and home and community gardens.</p>
