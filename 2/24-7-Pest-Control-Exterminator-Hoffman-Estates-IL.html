The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, diseases, and weeds, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is scouted, record arthropod pest numbers, place within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants examined. It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides may be more unsafe in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these thresholds change for modifications in market value, stage of crop development, cost of pesticides, and so on, but in truth most are based on fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
