A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
