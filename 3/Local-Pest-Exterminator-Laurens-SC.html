<p>A specific pest can be managed by certain options, however they may not all be offered in a specific location, for a specific crop, or within the available monetary ways. IPM involves using the best combination of cultural, biological and chemical steps for specific scenarios, consisting of plant biotechnology as appropriate. This planning consists of attention to field histories to expect what the pest problems may be, choosing crop ranges which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, picking tillage systems that will suppress anticipated pest damage while providing the crop the greatest yield potential.</p>
<p>Having completed the MSc you will have the ability to identify the underlying causes of major pest and illness issues and recognize economically essential insects, plant diseases and weeds.
