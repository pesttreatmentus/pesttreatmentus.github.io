<p>The numerous factors associated with the value chain of the insect pest control market include raw material providers, R&D institutes, insect pest control solutions making companies such as Bayer (Germany), Syngenta (Switzerland), BASF (Germany), FMC Corporation (US), and government bodies & regulatory associations such as the Epa (EPA) and Pest Management Regulatory Firm (PMRA).</p>
<p>To make sure least impact of our pest treatments on environments, we use products that cause least impact on the environment.

We provide both pest control services for both residential and industrial areas.</p>
<p>You just need to spend an hour on the web to be overwhelmed by international issues: the vicious circle that emerges from the use of big amounts of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn triggers resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most important component of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will practically have actually run out.</p>
<p>Consider alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Current missions for reliable, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted primarily toward development of brand-new and better products with which to replace standard hazardous pesticides.</p>
