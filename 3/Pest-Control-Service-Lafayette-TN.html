D's has been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Directive on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are required to consider the concepts of IPM before making use of chemicals.

Termites' or White ants' are called silent killer, their existence is undiscovered up until the wood exhibit surface damages. Whether it is termites, bed bugs, cockroaches, rodents, ants, lizards, mosquitoes or spiders, we assist you in dealing pests at your home and restore your smile. Pests managed: Insecticidal soap sprays are extremely reliable versus mites, aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects along with the softer nymph phases of some tough-bodied bugs.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential component of an integrated pest management program. But by focusing on non-chemical options first, you can make sure that your pest management program is effectively getting rid of pests at the least danger to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>For instance, management of the Soybean aphid consists of entomologists who study the bug and their damage to soybean, agronomists that determine crop phase which are most susceptible to soybean aphid damage, plant pathologists who study the infections transmitted by aphid feeding, and soil scientists who study the aphids interaction with nutrient deficiencies.</p>
