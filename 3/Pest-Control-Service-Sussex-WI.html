<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very reliable in triggering significant reductions in pest populations in specific scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

Recent quests for reliable, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted mostly towards development of brand-new and better items with which to change standard toxic pesticides.</p>
