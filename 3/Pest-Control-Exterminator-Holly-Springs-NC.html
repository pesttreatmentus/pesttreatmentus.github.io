<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The red imported fire ant is a widely known and frustrating  pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after regular tracking suggests that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Many individual commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM suggests for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in minimal locations.</p>
<p>Insect, weed, and disease issues are minimized through natural control by the enriched natural opponent fauna, the use of weed-competitive or illness- and pest-resistant varieties (with a focus on long lasting systems for resistance), decrease of nitrogen fertilization, and judicious usage of chemical pest control based upon careful population tasting and decision limits.</p>
