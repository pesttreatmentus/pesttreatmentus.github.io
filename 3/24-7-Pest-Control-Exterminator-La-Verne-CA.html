<p>There are numerous pest control companies located all over the city, that is why, is essential to understand which one is the best in order to avoid being cheated by any mediocre company.

<p>Typically, the main goal of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to include diseases, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management goals of sites such as residential and commercial structures, yard and grass locations, and home and neighborhood gardens.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in organic farming might control some pests, however can adversely impact natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might encourage natural enemy populations, but a higher variety of natural enemies does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have an unfavorable impact on the environment.</p>
