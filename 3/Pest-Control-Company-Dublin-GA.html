<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are committed to offering the best possible service to secure versus undesirable pests. The following example describes the 6 components of an Integrated Pest Management program utilized to handle carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest avoidance, an effective IPM program utilizes a mix of control techniques consisting of biological control, habitat manipulation, modifications to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, environment control, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>The numerous varying hazards from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections.

With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Recent quests for reliable, safe, and enduring pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily toward advancement of brand-new and better items with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
