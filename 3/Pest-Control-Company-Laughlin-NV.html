A single spotting of any pest in a warehouse during an audit can indicate a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your personal belongings with poisonous chemicals, ruin the air quality in your house or business, potentially infect food and other perishables, and just kills pests at the surface area of the issue.</p>
