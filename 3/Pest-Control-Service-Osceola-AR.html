<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of reasonable and moral factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of qualified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM execution in developed countries.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing clear signs that a pest control program is certainly an IPM system, it is likewise required to offer requirements to determine performance of the system. Typically between thirty minutes to 2 hours is required to execute the basic pest control treatment. Public need is affected by retail marketing methods, issues for food security based on pesticide policies in their region, and an absence of understanding on food production to name a few elements.</p>
<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in such a way that reduces their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the components or product packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
