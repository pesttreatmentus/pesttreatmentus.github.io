Most of insecticides fall into the chemical category since they are usually more reliable and can normally be utilized to control numerous pests. Physical barriers such as fences, internet, mulch, and tree trunk guards can exclude pests and minimize the damage they inflict.</p>
<p>In addition to developing clear indicators that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is also needed to supply requirements to determine performance of the system.
