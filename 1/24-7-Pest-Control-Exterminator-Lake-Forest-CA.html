Genuinely acceptable services to pest issues will require a shift to understanding and promoting naturally occurring biological representatives and other intrinsic strengths as components of total agricultural communities and developing our cropping systems so that these natural forces keep the pests within appropriate bounds.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and prevent pest determination include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>

<p>A few of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, effective against red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixtures, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>

Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
