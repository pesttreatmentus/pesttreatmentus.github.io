<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its ability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of ecologically unsound approaches as well as its array of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have actually been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the likelihood that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>They thought that some qualities of areawide management are incompatible with lots of standard IRM strategies, however suggested that the use of biologically based control techniques, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may contribute to both areawide pest management and IRM.
