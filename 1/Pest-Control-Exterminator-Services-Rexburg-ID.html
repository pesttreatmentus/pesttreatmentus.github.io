<p>Although several sources define IPM in various ways, previous designs mostly concentrated on the ecological, and to some degree on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) identified an absence of a holistic IPM technique that utilizes both standard and modern tools.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are used just when needed and in combination with other methods for more reliable, long-lasting control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the reduction in insecticides, because they work with other pest management methods, specifically biological control. Figure out the most reliable pesticide for your pest problem and make certain the pesticide you choose is developed for the pest you intend to use it on.</p>
