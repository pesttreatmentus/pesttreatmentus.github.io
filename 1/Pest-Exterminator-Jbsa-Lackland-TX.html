D's has been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
