<h3>Pest Control Estimate New Martinsville WV 26155</h3>
<p>For some tasks, pest control employees utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice known as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though contested by some as a legitimate procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>

<p>Integrated pest management means mindful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of appropriate procedures that discourage the development of populations of hazardous organisms and keep the use of plant defense products and other forms of intervention to levels that are financially and environmentally warranted and minimize or minimise risks to human health and the environment.</p>
