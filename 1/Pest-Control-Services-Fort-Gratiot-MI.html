<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
