<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
