<p>Numerous more recent pesticides are originated from plants or naturally taking place compounds (e.g.-- nicotine, pest and pyrethrum juvenile hormonal agent analogues), however the toxophore or active part may be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability.

<p>Take advantage of previous experience by focusing on plant types that tend to be vulnerable to arthropod pests. The plant science market, represented by CropLife International, provides a large range of appropriate innovations, product and services that can be incorporated into IPM methods.
