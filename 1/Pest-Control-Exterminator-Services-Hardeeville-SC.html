<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of moral and logical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of qualified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing clear indicators that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is likewise essential to offer requirements to measure performance of the system. Normally in between 30 minutes to 2 hours is needed to perform the basic pest control treatment. Public demand is affected by retail marketing methods, concerns for food safety based on pesticide policies in their region, and an absence of understanding on food production among other elements.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a process that is used to control pest populations while reducing the impacts on people and the surrounding environment. Though there is a debate of using chemicals due to ecological pollution it is a fact that this is the only technique which is widely accepted and offered reliable control of pest.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are warded off or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide issues are brought on by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
