Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a ecologically sensitive and effective approach to pest management that depends on a mix of common-sense practices. IPM is a method to ensure economic practicality at both customer and manufacturer level (seller is always anticipated to earn a profit), ecological safety through a balanced use of all readily available pest control alternatives, and social reputation considering that IPM-based food is safe and economical.</p>
