<p>Tighter regulations for food security, occupational health and wellness, and the environment mean internal pest control isn't a choice for lots of food companies nowadays. Farmers are faced with myriad of production challenges where the most common problems are pests, that include insects, weeds, and diseases. Similarly, pest and crop management disciplines must work together to establish control recommendations that reflect these interactions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses many of the very same ideas as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
