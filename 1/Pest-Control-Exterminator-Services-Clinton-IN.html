<p>Socio-psychological aspects including rational and ethical factors to consider were found to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).

Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
