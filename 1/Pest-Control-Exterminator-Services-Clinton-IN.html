<p>Socio-psychological aspects including rational and ethical factors to consider were found to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
