<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels.

IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, environment manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, documents, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, therefore triggering gigantic damage within just a couple of months.
