D's has been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment.

<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxins in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very reliable in causing significant decreases in pest populations in specific situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural enemies or saving natural opponent populations by supplying havens or avoiding practices that hurt them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
