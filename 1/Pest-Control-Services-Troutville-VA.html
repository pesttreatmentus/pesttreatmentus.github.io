<p>Pest, weed, and disease issues are reduced through natural control by the enriched natural enemy animals, using weed-competitive or disease- and pest-resistant varieties (with a focus on durable systems for resistance), reduction of nitrogen fertilization, and sensible use of chemical pest control based on cautious population tasting and choice thresholds.</p>
