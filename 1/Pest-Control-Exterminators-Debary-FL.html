<p>By establishing a personalized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the right controls-- when pests appear, and then rest easy. Consideration of crop plants as active elements of multitrophic level interactions is essential to a total systems approach to pest management. Commercial pest control companies have responsibilities that go far beyond that of handling and removing pests.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest perseverance consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics need to be measured using signs based upon monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and effect on the environment. These include the resurgence of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
