<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family pest pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about minimizing pesticide use.

<p>Pesticides are either unscheduled or they fall under schedules 5, 6 or 7. Each schedule has a warning, which appears in large contrasting lettering on the label. At this time, Advanced Providers does not prepare to shut down operations due to COVID-19 (coronavirus) as our services have been designated by the Department of Homeland Security as an important service.</p>
