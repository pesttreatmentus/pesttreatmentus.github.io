The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though contested by some as a valid step, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the increase of pest control.</p>
